Problem 4
(20 points) Use your own words to introduce your heuristic algorithm to the instruct-
ing team. You may write paragraphs of words, draw flow charts, present pseudocodes,
and/or provide examples. There should also be a basic big-O analysis regarding the
time complexity of your algorithm. Points will be given to you according to the logic of
your algorithm and clearness of your description. Please try your best to convince the
instructing team that your algorithm design is intuitively good.
